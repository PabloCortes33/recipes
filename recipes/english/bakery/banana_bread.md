# The Best Banana Bread Recipe

This recipe focuses on using ripe bananas and proper mixing techniques to achieve a perfectly moist and delicious banana bread.

**Yields:** 1 loaf
**Prep time:** 15 minutes
**Bake time:** 50-60 minutes

**Ingredients:**

*   3-4 very ripe medium bananas (or 2-3 large), mashed
*   ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened or melted
*   ¾ cup granulated sugar (or a mix of granulated and brown sugar for added moisture and flavor)
*   2 large eggs
*   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*   1¾ cups all-purpose flour (or 2 cups)
*   1 teaspoon baking soda
*   ½ teaspoon salt
*   ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional, for warmth)
*   ½ cup sour cream or plain yogurt (optional, for extra moisture)
*   Optional additions: ½ cup chopped walnuts or chocolate chips

**Instructions:**

1.  **Preheat Oven & Prepare Pan:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan, or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.
2.  **Mash Bananas:** In a medium bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork or potato masher until mostly smooth with a few small lumps remaining.
3.  **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon (if using). Set aside.
4.  **Cream Wet Ingredients:** In a large bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. If using melted butter, simply whisk it with the sugar until combined.
5.  **Add Eggs & Flavorings:** Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract, mashed bananas, and sour cream/yogurt (if using) until just combined.
6.  **Combine Wet and Dry:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed or by hand with a spatula until *just* combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a tough bread. If adding walnuts or chocolate chips, fold them in now.
7.  **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread evenly. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. (Some recipes suggest 325°F, which can also work for a slightly longer bake time).
8.  **Cool:** Let the banana bread cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before carefully removing it and transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.

**Tips for Success:**

*   **Ripe Bananas are Key:** Use bananas that are very ripe, with plenty of brown spots on the peel. This ensures maximum sweetness and banana flavor.
*   **Don't Overmix:** Overmixing develops gluten, which can make the bread tough. Mix only until the ingredients are just combined.
*   **Storage:** Store leftover banana bread at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3-4 days, or freeze for longer storage.
