# Authentic Neapolitan Pizza Sauce (VPN Certified)

## Overview

Authentic Neapolitan pizza sauce is a celebration of simplicity. This raw sauce method preserves the fresh, vibrant flavor of high-quality tomatoes and requires no cooking. The intense heat of a Neapolitan oven (900°F/485°C) cooks the sauce during the 60-90 second bake, avoiding a "twice-cooked" flavor.

## VPN Certification Requirements

The **Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (VPN)** has strict requirements for authentic Neapolitan pizza:

- Must use **D.O.P. certified** San Marzano dell'Agro Sarnese-Nocerino, Pomodorini di Corbara, or Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio tomatoes
- Tomatoes must be **hand-crushed** or processed with a low-speed mechanical press for a rustic texture
- **No cooking** is permitted
- Strictest interpretation: tomatoes and salt only
- Commonly accepted additions: fresh basil and extra-virgin olive oil
- **No oregano, garlic, or onion** in the official VPN recipe

## Ingredients

**Yields:** Enough for 3-4 Neapolitan pizzas (10-12 inches)

- 800g / 28 oz whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes (D.O.P. certified)
- 10-12g / 1.5-2 tsp fine sea salt
- 10-15 fresh basil leaves
- 30ml / 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil

## Method

1. **Hand-crush the tomatoes** in a large bowl until you achieve a chunky yet sauce-like consistency. The texture should be rustic, not smooth.

2. **Remove any tough stems or cores** you encounter while crushing.

3. **Add the salt** and stir gently to combine.

4. **Tear the basil leaves by hand** (don't cut them with a knife) and add to the sauce.

5. **Drizzle the extra-virgin olive oil** over the sauce.

6. **Gently combine** all ingredients without over-mixing. The sauce should remain chunky and rustic.

7. **Let the sauce rest** for 30 minutes at room temperature before using. This allows the flavors to meld.

## Why This Method Works

- **Raw sauce** preserves the bright, fresh tomato flavor
- The **high oven temperature** (900°F/485°C) cooks the sauce perfectly during the short baking time
- **Hand-crushing** creates the ideal rustic texture and prevents bitterness from over-processing
- **Minimal ingredients** let the quality of the tomatoes shine through

## Tips for Success

- **Quality matters:** San Marzano D.O.P. tomatoes are essential. Look for the official D.O.P. certification seal on the can.
- **Don't over-mix:** The sauce should remain chunky and rustic.
- **Room temperature:** Always use sauce at room temperature, never cold from the refrigerator.
- **Less is more:** Use a light hand when spreading - you should see spots of dough through the sauce.
- **Use 2-4 oz per pizza:** For a 10-12 inch Neapolitan pizza, this is the ideal amount.

## Storage

- **Refrigerator:** Store in an airtight container for up to 4-5 days
- **Freezer:** Freeze in portions for up to 6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

## Identifying Quality San Marzano Tomatoes

- Look for the **D.O.P. certification seal** - two official seals should appear on the can
- **Ingredients should be simple:** tomatoes, salt, and possibly basil. Avoid cans with added sugar or preservatives
- **Can condition:** No dents, rust, or bulges
- **Whole peeled tomatoes** in juice or puree offer the best quality
