# Roasted Tomato Sauce

This method yields a rich, flavorful sauce perfect for pasta, pizza, or as a base for other dishes. Roasting the tomatoes brings out their natural sweetness and deepens their flavor.

**Yields:** Approximately 4-6 servings
**Prep time:** 15 minutes
**Cook time:** 45-60 minutes

## Ingredients:

*   2 lbs (about 1 kg) ripe tomatoes (Roma, cherry, or a mix work well), halved or quartered if large
*   1 head garlic, cloves separated and peeled
*   1/4 cup olive oil
*   1 teaspoon dried oregano (or 1 tablespoon fresh, chopped)
*   1/2 teaspoon dried basil (or 1 tablespoon fresh, chopped)
*   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
*   1/4 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste
*   Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional, for a little heat)
*   Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:

1.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2.  **Prepare Tomatoes:** Wash and prepare your tomatoes. If using larger tomatoes, cut them into halves or quarters. Cherry tomatoes can be left whole.
3.  **Arrange on Baking Sheet:** Spread the tomatoes and peeled garlic cloves in a single layer on a large baking sheet. You can line the baking sheet with parchment paper for easier cleanup.
4.  **Season:** Drizzle the olive oil over the tomatoes and garlic. Sprinkle with dried oregano, dried basil, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Toss gently to coat everything evenly.
5.  **Roast:** Roast for 45-60 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft, slightly caramelized, and the garlic is tender and fragrant. The skins of the tomatoes might blister and char slightly, which adds to the flavor.
6.  **Cool Slightly:** Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the roasted vegetables cool for about 10-15 minutes.
7.  **Blend (Optional):**
    *   **For a chunky sauce:** You can simply mash the tomatoes and garlic with a fork or potato masher directly on the baking sheet or in a bowl.
    *   **For a smoother sauce:** Carefully transfer the roasted tomatoes and garlic (including any juices from the baking sheet) to a blender or food processor. Blend until you reach your desired consistency. Be careful when blending hot liquids; start on a low speed and gradually increase.
8.  **Adjust Seasoning:** Taste the sauce and adjust salt, pepper, or other seasonings as needed. If the sauce is too acidic, you can add a pinch of sugar.
9.  **Serve:** Serve warm over your favorite pasta, as a base for pizza, or with grilled chicken or vegetables. Garnish with fresh basil if desired.

## Tips:

*   **Tomato Choice:** Ripe, in-season tomatoes will give you the best flavor. San Marzano tomatoes are excellent if you can find them.
*   **Garlic:** Don't be shy with the garlic; roasting mellows its flavor beautifully.
*   **Herbs:** Feel free to experiment with other herbs like thyme or rosemary.
*   **Storage:** Leftover sauce can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.
