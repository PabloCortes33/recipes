# Detroit-Style Pizza Sauce

## Overview

Detroit-style pizza sauce is sweet, thick, and distinctive. Unlike most pizza styles, the sauce is applied **in stripes** or dollops on top of the cheese and toppings, sometimes even after baking. This creates the iconic "racing stripes" appearance. The sauce is cooked to develop a rich, sweet flavor that balances the crispy, cheesy edges of Detroit-style pizza.

## Ingredients

**Yields:** Enough for 2-3 Detroit-style pizzas (10x14 inches)

- 28 oz / 794g crushed tomatoes
- 6 oz / 170g tomato paste
- 2-4 tbsp / 30-60ml olive oil
- 1-2 tsp / 5-10ml dried oregano
- 1 tsp / 5ml dried basil (optional)
- 2-3 cloves minced garlic OR 1 tsp / 5ml granulated garlic
- 1 tsp / 5ml salt (or to taste)
- 1 tsp / 5ml sugar (optional, for extra sweetness)
- 1/2 to 1 cup / 120-240ml water
- 1/2 tsp / 2ml red pepper flakes (optional)

## Method

1. **Combine all ingredients** in a medium saucepan with 1/2 cup (120ml) water.

2. **Stir well** to incorporate the tomato paste completely.

3. **Bring to a gentle simmer** over medium-low heat.

4. **Simmer with the lid slightly ajar** for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.

5. **Monitor consistency:** The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and hold its shape when dolloped. It should be noticeably thicker than most pizza sauces.

6. **Adjust thickness:**
   - If too thick: Add more water 1 tablespoon at a time
   - If too thin: Continue simmering to reduce

7. **Taste and adjust** seasoning as needed. The sauce should have a balanced sweet-savory profile.

8. **Cool slightly** before using. The sauce can be used warm or at room temperature.

## Why This Method Works

- **Sweet profile** balances the rich, buttery cheese and crispy crust edges
- **Thick consistency** allows it to stay in place when applied in stripes on top
- **Tomato paste** adds body and concentrated tomato flavor
- **Cooked sauce** develops a richer, more complex flavor
- **Applied on top** (or after baking) prevents the crust from becoming soggy and creates visual appeal

## Tips for Success

- **Make it sweet:** Detroit sauce is characteristically sweet. Don't be afraid to add the full teaspoon of sugar.
- **Very thick:** The sauce should be thick enough to spoon onto the pizza in distinct stripes
- **Racing stripes:** Use a spoon or ladle to create 2-3 parallel stripes across the top of the pizza
- **After baking option:** Some recipes call for adding the sauce after the pizza bakes for 10-15 minutes, then returning to oven
- **Balance is key:** The sweetness should balance the rich, caramelized cheese edges

## Application Methods

### Method 1: Before Baking
1. Add cheese and toppings to dough in rectangular pan
2. Ladle sauce in 2-3 parallel stripes across the top
3. Bake at 500-550°F (260-290°C) for 12-15 minutes

### Method 2: After Partial Baking
1. Add cheese and toppings to dough, bake without sauce for 10 minutes
2. Remove from oven, ladle sauce in stripes
3. Return to oven for 5-7 minutes to finish

## Storage

- **Refrigerator:** Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week
- **Freezer:** Freeze in portions for up to 6 months. Thaw and reheat gently before using.

## What Makes Detroit Sauce Unique

- **Sweetest** of all regional American pizza sauces
- **Thickest** consistency due to tomato paste
- **Applied on top** in distinctive stripes rather than under cheese
- **Sometimes added after partial baking** for fresher flavor
- **Balances** the intensely savory, caramelized cheese crust edges
