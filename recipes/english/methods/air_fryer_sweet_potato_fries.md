# Air Fryer Sweet Potato Fries

For a healthier alternative to deep-fried fries, the air fryer works wonderfully.

## Ingredients

*   1 lb sweet potatoes
*   1 tbsp olive oil
*   1/2 tsp garlic powder
*   1/2 tsp paprika
*   Salt to taste

## Instructions

1.  **Preparation:** Peel sweet potatoes and slice them into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick sticks. For extra crispiness, some recommend soaking the cut fries in water for at least 30 minutes before cooking, then drying them thoroughly.
2.  **Seasoning:** Toss the fries with a small amount of olive oil, garlic powder, and paprika.
3.  **Air Frying:** Preheat the air fryer to 380°F (193°C).
4.  **Cooking:** Cook in batches in a single layer for 10-15 minutes, turning or shaking halfway through. The cooking time may vary, so check for desired crispiness and tenderness. Salt after cooking for best results.
