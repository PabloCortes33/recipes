# New York-Style Pizza Sauce

## Overview

New York-style pizza sauce is characterized by its bright, brightly flavored profile and smooth texture. Unlike Neapolitan sauce, it can be lightly cooked or used raw, and typically includes dried oregano for that classic pizzeria taste. This sauce is designed to complement the chewy, foldable New York-style crust.

## Ingredients

**Yields:** Enough for 3-4 pizzas (12-14 inches)

- 28 oz / 794g high-quality whole peeled tomatoes (San Marzano recommended)
- 1 tbsp / 15ml extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
- Pinch of sugar (to taste, for balancing acidity)

## Method

### No-Cook Version (Traditional)

1. **Hand-crush the tomatoes** in a large bowl to achieve a slightly chunky consistency. You can also use a few quick pulses in a blender, but don't over-blend.

2. **Stir in the olive oil**, oregano, salt, black pepper, and garlic (if using).

3. **Taste the sauce** and add a small pinch of sugar if the tomatoes are too acidic. San Marzano tomatoes are naturally sweet and may not need sugar.

4. **Let rest** for 15-30 minutes at room temperature before using to allow flavors to meld.

### Quick-Cooked Version (15-20 Minutes)

1. **Heat the olive oil** in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

2. **Add the garlic** (if using) and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Don't let it brown.

3. **Add the tomatoes** (hand-crushed or pulsed in blender), oregano, salt, and pepper.

4. **Bring to a simmer**, then reduce heat to low.

5. **Simmer for 15-20 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly.

6. **Taste and adjust** seasoning, adding a pinch of sugar if needed.

7. **Cool completely** before using on pizza.

## Why This Method Works

- **Dried oregano** is the signature flavor of New York-style pizza sauce
- **Minimal cooking** (or no cooking) preserves the bright tomato flavor
- **Smooth-ish texture** spreads easily on the dough and doesn't compete with toppings
- **Balanced seasoning** complements the chewy crust and generous cheese typical of NY pizza

## Tips for Success

- **Use quality tomatoes:** San Marzano or high-quality whole peeled tomatoes make a huge difference
- **Don't over-season:** The sauce should enhance, not overpower the pizza
- **Room temperature:** Always spread sauce at room temperature, never cold
- **Thin layer:** Use 1/3 to 1/2 cup per 12-14 inch pizza, spread in a thin, even layer
- **Leave a border:** Keep 1/2 to 1 inch clear around the edge for the crust

## Sauce Quantity Guide

- **12-inch pizza:** ~1/3 cup (80g / 5 tbsp)
- **14-inch pizza:** ~1/2 cup (120g / 8 tbsp)
- **16-inch pizza:** ~2/3 cup (160g / 10 tbsp)

## Storage

- **Refrigerator:** Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week
- **Freezer:** Freeze in portions for up to 6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

## Variations

- **Add butter:** Some NYC pizzerias add 1-2 tablespoons of butter for richness
- **More garlic:** Increase garlic to 2-3 cloves for a more pronounced flavor
- **Red pepper flakes:** Add 1/4 teaspoon for a slight kick
- **Fresh basil:** Tear in a few fresh basil leaves at the end for added freshness
