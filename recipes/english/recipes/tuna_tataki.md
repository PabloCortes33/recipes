# Tuna Tataki (Tataki Tuna)

A Japanese dish featuring high-quality sushi-grade tuna that's quickly seared on the outside while remaining raw inside, then thinly sliced and served with citrus-based ponzu sauce.

**Yields:** 2 servings
**Prep time:** 15 minutes (plus 4 hours for ponzu)
**Cook time:** 2 minutes

**Ingredients:**

*For the Tuna:*
*   10-12 oz (300-340g) sushi-grade tuna block (at least 2 inches thick)
*   1 tablespoon vegetable oil or neutral high-heat oil
*   Salt and freshly ground black pepper

*For Ponzu Sauce:*
*   1/2 cup soy sauce
*   1/4 cup fresh citrus juice (yuzu preferred, or lemon-lime mix)
*   2 tablespoons mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine)
*   1 tablespoon rice vinegar
*   2x2 inch piece kombu (dried kelp)
*   1/4 cup katsuobushi (bonito flakes) - optional

*For Serving:*
*   Julienned daikon radish
*   Thinly sliced scallions or chives
*   Grated fresh ginger
*   Toasted sesame seeds
*   Shiso leaves (perilla) - optional

**Equipment:**
*   Heavy-bottomed skillet (cast iron or stainless steel)
*   Very sharp knife (Yanagiba or chef's knife)
*   Ice bath (large bowl with ice and water)
*   Paper towels
*   Fine-mesh strainer (for ponzu)

**Instructions:**

1.  **Make the Ponzu Sauce (make ahead):** Combine soy sauce, citrus juice, mirin, and rice vinegar in a jar. Add kombu and bonito flakes (if using). Seal and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (overnight is best). Strain through fine-mesh sieve before using. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

2.  **Dry the Tuna:** Remove tuna from refrigerator and pat completely dry with paper towels. Keep refrigerated until moment of searing.

3.  **Season:** Generously season all four long sides of the tuna block with salt and pepper.

4.  **Heat Pan:** Place heavy-bottomed skillet over HIGH heat. Heat 1 tablespoon oil until shimmering and almost smoking.

5.  **Sear:** Place tuna in hot pan and sear each of the four long sides for 15-20 seconds only. The goal is to cook only the outer 1/8 inch (2-3mm), leaving the center completely raw. Do NOT sear the two shorter ends.

6.  **Chill Immediately:** Plunge the seared tuna into ice water for 10-15 seconds to stop the cooking process.

7.  **Dry and Slice:** Remove from ice bath and pat very dry with paper towels. Using a very sharp knife, slice against the grain into 1/4-inch (5-6mm) thick slices.

8.  **Serve:** Arrange sliced tuna on plates immediately. Drizzle with ponzu sauce and garnish with daikon, scallions, ginger, sesame seeds, and shiso leaves if using.

**Tips:**
*   Always use commercially frozen, sushi-grade tuna from a reputable source. Look for vibrant deep red color, moist and glossy appearance, and fresh ocean scent.
*   Keep tuna refrigerated until the exact moment of searing. High heat + cold fish = perfect sear with raw center.
*   The pan must be extremely hot for a quick sear. Oil should be almost smoking.
*   Use the ice bath immediately after searing to prevent overcooking the interior.
*   Slice with a single, smooth pulling motion for clean cuts.
*   Best tuna types: Bluefin (Maguro), Yellowfin (Ahi), or Bigeye tuna.
