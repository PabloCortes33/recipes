# Crostini With Blistered Cherry Tomatoes, Burrata and Chive Oil

This recipe takes the elements of a Caprese salad and presents them on crostini, featuring blistered cherry tomatoes and creamy burrata.

**Yields:** 12 crostini
**Prep time:** 25 minutes
**Cook time:** 20 minutes

**Ingredients:**
*   1 large bunch fresh chives (2 1/4 ounces; 65 g)
*   1/2 cup canola or other neutral oil
*   2 pints heirloom cherry tomatoes (1 1/4 pounds; 565 g)
*   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil (120 ml), plus more for drizzling and brushing
*   3 medium cloves garlic, sliced
*   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
*   1 baguette, cut on a bias into about twelve 1/4 inch thick slices
*   1 large ball burrata, torn into large chunks
*   Micro greens or minced chives, for garnish (optional)

**Equipment:**
*   Blender
*   Fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth-lined sieve
*   10-inch cast iron or other heavy skillet
*   Baking sheet

**Instructions:**

1.  **Make the Chive Oil:** Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Bring a medium pot of water to a full boil and prepare an ice bath. Blanch the chives in boiling water for 1 minute, then transfer to the ice water. Once cold, drain and dry the chives as much as possible with paper towels. Put the chives in a blender with the canola oil and blend at high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Let stand for 15 minutes. Strain into a clean bowl through a fine-mesh strainer (or cheesecloth-lined sieve), pressing gently to extract all the oil; discard the solids. Transfer the chive oil to a jar or plastic squeeze bottle. The oil can be refrigerated for up to 3 weeks; bring to room temperature before using.
2.  **Blister the Cherry Tomatoes:** In a 10-inch cast iron or other heavy skillet, heat 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil over high heat until shimmering. Add the tomatoes and cook without stirring until they blister and char on the bottom side, about 1 minute. Stir gently and cook until blistered in a few more spots, 1 to 2 minutes longer (they should be blistered and lightly browned in spots, but not falling apart). Remove from heat, add the sliced garlic, and stir until the tomatoes soften and the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute (if the pan isn't hot enough, return to low heat). Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl, drizzle with fresh olive oil, and set aside.
3.  **Prepare the Crostini:** Brush both sides of each baguette slice with olive oil. Arrange on a baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes. Flip and cook until the toasts are light golden brown, about 3 minutes longer.
4.  **Assemble:** Top each toast with the blistered tomatoes and their juices. Drape a piece of torn burrata on top of each toast. Drizzle with chive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and garnish with micro greens or minced chives, if desired.
