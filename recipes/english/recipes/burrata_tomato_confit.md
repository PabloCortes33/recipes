# Burrata with Tomato Confit

## Overview

This luxurious dish features slow-cooked tomato confit - cherry tomatoes gently poached in olive oil with garlic and herbs until they become tender, intensely flavored jewels. Paired with creamy burrata, this elegant starter is perfect for special occasions. The confit can be made days ahead, making it ideal for entertaining.

## What is Tomato Confit?

Confit is a French cooking technique where food is slowly cooked in fat at a low temperature. For tomatoes, this gentle method concentrates their flavor while keeping them tender and creating a richly infused oil that's almost as valuable as the tomatoes themselves.

## Servings & Timing

- **Serves:** 4 as an appetizer
- **Prep Time:** 10 minutes
- **Cook Time:** 2-3 hours
- **Total Time:** 2-3 hours 10 minutes

## Ingredients

**For the Tomato Confit:**
- 2 lbs / 900g cherry or grape tomatoes
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 1.5 cups / 360ml extra-virgin olive oil (enough to cover tomatoes)
- 1 tsp / 5g kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp / 2g freshly cracked black pepper
- 1/2 tsp / 2g sugar (optional, to balance acidity)

**For Serving:**
- 2 balls fresh burrata cheese (8-8.8 oz / 225-250g total)
- Fresh basil leaves
- Flaky sea salt
- Crusty bread, crostini, or focaccia

## Instructions

### Making the Tomato Confit:

1. **Preheat the oven:** Set oven to 275°F (135°C).

2. **Prepare the baking dish:** Choose an oven-safe dish (9x13 inch baking dish or similar) that will hold the tomatoes in a relatively snug single layer.

3. **Arrange ingredients:** Place the cherry tomatoes, whole garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and rosemary sprigs in the baking dish.

4. **Add oil and seasonings:** Pour the olive oil over the tomatoes - they should be mostly or completely submerged. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and sugar (if using).

5. **Slow-roast:** Place in the oven and cook for 2-3 hours. The tomatoes are ready when they're very soft, slightly wrinkled, and some have started to split. They should be tender but still hold their shape.

6. **Cool completely:** Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature in the oil. As they cool, the tomatoes will absorb more flavor from the oil and herbs.

### Assembling the Dish:

7. **Bring burrata to room temperature:** Remove burrata from refrigerator 30-60 minutes before serving.

8. **Warm the confit (optional):** You can serve the tomato confit at room temperature, or gently warm it in a small saucepan over low heat for 5-10 minutes. Do not overheat.

9. **Plate:** Place the burrata balls on a serving platter. Spoon the tomato confit around and over the burrata, including some of the garlic cloves and infused oil. Remove the herb sprigs or leave for rustic presentation.

10. **Garnish:** Tear fresh basil leaves over the top and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

11. **Serve:** Present with crusty bread or crostini to soak up the precious infused oil.

## Why This Works

- **Concentrated flavor:** Slow cooking intensifies the tomato flavor without bitterness
- **Texture transformation:** Tomatoes become melt-in-your-mouth tender
- **Infused oil:** The oil becomes a flavorful condiment in its own right
- **Make-ahead friendly:** Can be prepared days in advance for stress-free entertaining
- **Versatility:** The confit works with many dishes beyond burrata

## Tips for Success

- **Oil coverage:** Tomatoes should be mostly submerged in oil to cook evenly
- **Low and slow:** Don't rush by increasing temperature - gentle heat is key
- **Check doneness:** Tomatoes should be very soft but not falling apart
- **Save the oil:** The herb and garlic-infused oil is incredibly valuable - save every drop
- **Quality olive oil:** Since oil is a major component, use good quality (but save your most expensive bottle for finishing)

## Storage

- **Refrigerator:** Store tomato confit in an airtight container with the oil for up to 2 weeks
- **Key tip:** Tomatoes must remain fully submerged in oil for preservation
- **Freezing:** Not recommended as it affects texture
- **Infused oil:** Can be strained and stored separately for up to 1 month in the refrigerator
