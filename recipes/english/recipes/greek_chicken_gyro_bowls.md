For chicken:
1lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or breast) 
1 cup Greek yogurt
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsps fresh lemon juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tsp salt

1/2 tsp salt 
1/4 tsp black pepper 
1/2 tsp paprika

In a bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, & pepper, to create marinade. Add chicken and toss to coat completely. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the fridge. To cook, either air fry at 385F for 20 minutes, flipping half way (air fryer times vary).

For potatoes, Cut potatoes and add to a bowl. Add oil and seasoning and mix until combined. Adjust seasonings to your preferences! Add to air fryer in an even layer & air fry at 400F for 20 minutes. 

Build your bowl with base of cooked rice, couscou, or quinoa and add diced cucumbers, chopped tomatoes, red onion, crumbled feta, Kalamata olives, - options are up to you! Add chicken, potatoes, & serve with tzatziki! Enjoy!
