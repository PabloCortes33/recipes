*   2-4 cloves garlic, minced or chopped

*   1 teaspoon dried mint (optional, for a unique flavor)
*   1/4 teaspoon allspice (optional)
*   1 (14.5 ounce) can diced or chopped tomatoes, or 1.5 cups fresh diced tomatoes
*   1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
*   1.5 cups water or beef broth (if using broth, adjust salt)
*   4-8 medium zucchini (about 1.5-2 lbs), cut into 1/2-inch thick slices or bite-sized pieces
*   1 cup chopped fresh dill weed (optional)

## Instructions:

1.  **Toast Spices and Brown the Meat:** Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the cumin seeds and toast for about 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the diced onion and sauté for about 4 minutes until softened. Add the ground meat, breaking it up with a spoon. Season with salt, black pepper, Aleppo pepper (if using), dried mint (if using), and allspice (if using). Cook until the meat is browned, about 5-7 minutes. Drain any excess grease if necessary.
2.  **Add Tomatoes and Liquids:** Stir in the diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, and water (or beef broth). If using tomato paste, add it now. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil.
3.  **Simmer the Stew:** Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 10-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
4.  **Add Zucchini and Other Vegetables:** Add the zucchini slices or pieces to the pot. If using green bell pepper, potatoes, or mushrooms, add them now as well. Stir gently to combine.
5.  **Cook Until Tender:** Cover and continue to cook for another 10-15 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender but not mushy. If adding fresh dill, stir it in during the last few minutes of cooking.
6.  **Adjust Seasoning and Serve:** Taste the stew and adjust salt and pepper as needed. Serve hot with a dollop of plain yogurt. This stew is often served with rice or crusty bread.
