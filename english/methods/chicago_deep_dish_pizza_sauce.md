# Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza Sauce

## Overview

Chicago deep-dish pizza sauce is unique among pizza sauces - it's chunky, well-seasoned, and applied **on top of the cheese and toppings**, not directly on the dough. This prevents the thick crust from becoming soggy during the long baking time. The sauce is cooked to develop deep flavor and reduce moisture content.

## Ingredients

**Yields:** Enough for 2-3 deep-dish pizzas (12-14 inches)

- 28 oz / 794g crushed tomatoes
- 1/4 cup / 60ml olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp sugar

## Method

1. **Heat the olive oil** in a large saucepan over medium heat.

2. **Cook the onion** for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent.

3. **Add the garlic** and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Be careful not to burn it.

4. **Stir in the crushed tomatoes** and all seasonings (oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar).

5. **Bring to a simmer**, then reduce heat to low.

6. **Cook for 30-45 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick and chunky. The sauce should be very thick - much thicker than a typical pizza sauce.

7. **Taste and adjust** seasoning as needed. The sauce should be well-seasoned since it's the top layer.

8. **Cool completely** before using. The sauce should hold its shape when spooned.

## Why This Method Works

- **Chunky texture** provides visual appeal and interesting bite texture on top of the pizza
- **Cooked sauce** develops deeper, richer flavor that can stand up to the thick crust
- **Thick consistency** prevents the pizza from becoming soggy during the 35-45 minute bake time
- **Applied on top** creates the iconic Chicago deep-dish appearance and keeps the crust crispy
- **Well-seasoned** since it's the most prominent flavor layer

## Tips for Success

- **Make it thick:** The sauce should be very thick, almost paste-like. If it's too watery, simmer longer.
- **Cool completely:** Hot sauce will melt the cheese underneath and create a mess
- **Don't over-sauce:** Use about 3/4 to 1 cup of sauce per 12-14 inch deep-dish pizza
- **Spread evenly:** Cover the cheese and toppings completely with sauce
- **Season well:** Since the sauce is on top, it should be flavorful and well-seasoned

## Assembly Order for Deep-Dish Pizza

1. Press dough into deep pan, up the sides
2. Layer sliced mozzarella cheese directly on dough
3. Add toppings (sausage, vegetables, etc.)
4. Spread thick sauce over the top
5. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese
6. Bake at 425°F (220°C) for 35-45 minutes

## Storage

- **Refrigerator:** Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week
- **Freezer:** Freeze in portions for up to 6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

## Variations

- **Sausage-enhanced:** Cook Italian sausage with the onions for added flavor
- **Spicy:** Add 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for heat
- **Herb-forward:** Add 1 tsp fennel seeds for a more complex flavor
- **Tomato paste:** Add 2 tbsp tomato paste with the crushed tomatoes for extra richness and thickness
