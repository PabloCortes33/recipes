## Overview

This guide covers essential techniques for making and applying pizza sauce, from choosing ingredients to troubleshooting common problems. Master these techniques to elevate your homemade pizza.

## Tomato Selection Guide

### Types of Tomatoes

| Type | Characteristics | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **San Marzano D.O.P.** | Sweet, low acidity, dense flesh, few seeds, thick sauce | Authentic Neapolitan pizza, when you want the best |
| **Roma** | Versatile, affordable, low water content, dense flesh | All-purpose when San Marzanos unavailable |
| **Whole Peeled** | Highest quality, best control over texture | Preferred by chefs - crush by hand or blend |
| **Crushed** | Convenient but variable quality | Quick option, but whole peeled is better |
| **Tomato Passata** | Smooth, strained puree, no skins/seeds, fresh flavor | Smooth sauce with bright taste |
| **Tomato Puree** | Cooked and strained, thicker, "cooked" flavor | Can be used but lacks fresh flavor |

### Identifying Quality Canned Tomatoes

- **D.O.P. Certification:** Look for the official seal (two seals on can)
- **Simple ingredients:** Tomatoes, salt, possibly basil. Avoid added sugar or preservatives
- **Can condition:** No dents, rust, or bulges
- **Whole peeled in juice:** Offers best quality and versatility

**Recommended Brands:** Rega, La Fede, Strianese, Mutti, Cento, DeLallo

## Cooking Techniques

### Raw Sauce Method (No-Cook)

**When to Use:** Neapolitan-style pizzas, fresh bright tomato flavor desired, quick preparation

**Process:**
1. Start with high-quality canned tomatoes (San Marzano preferred)
2. Hand-crush tomatoes in bowl or use a few quick blender pulses
3. Add salt, fresh basil, drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
4. Stir to combine - don't over-mix
5. Ready to use immediately or after 30-minute rest

**Advantages:**
- Preserves fresh, bright tomato flavor
- Quick and easy (minutes to prepare)
- Vibrant red color

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be watery
- Less complex flavor than cooked sauce

### Quick-Cooked Sauce (15-20 Minutes)

**When to Use:** New York-style, American-style pizzas needing slightly more savory flavor

**Process:**
1. Sauté minced garlic and onion in olive oil until fragrant
2. Add crushed tomatoes, salt, dried herbs (oregano, basil)
3. Simmer 15-20 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally
4. Cool before using

**Temperature:** Low to medium-low with gentle bubbles, not rolling boil

**Tip:** Add pinch of sugar to balance acidity

### Long-Simmered Sauce (45-60+ Minutes)

**When to Use:** Deep-dish pizzas, robust sauce needed, make-ahead preparation

**Process:**
1. Follow same initial steps as quick-cooked
2. Simmer at least 45 minutes up to several hours
3. Sauce will thicken considerably and darken

**Benefits:**
- Deep, rich, concentrated tomato flavor
- More complex sauce
- Thick consistency prevents soggy pizza

**Tip:** Add bay leaf or Parmesan rind while simmering for extra flavor

### Hand-Crushing vs. Blending

**Hand-Crushing:**
- **Texture:** Chunkier, rustic
- **Flavor:** Brighter, fresher
- **When:** Traditional, less-processed sauce desired
- **Method:** Squeeze tomatoes through fingers into bowl, removing tough cores

**Blending:**
- **Texture:** Smoother, uniform
- **Flavor:** Slightly muted
- **When:** Very smooth sauce desired
- **Tip:** Don't over-blend (incorporates air, changes color/texture). Use immersion blender for best results

## Ingredient Ratios & Amounts

### Per 28 oz Can of Tomatoes

| Ingredient | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Salt** | 1/2 - 1 tsp | Start with less, adjust to taste |
| **Sugar** | 1/2 - 1 tsp | Only if tomatoes are acidic; San Marzanos usually don't need it |
| **Olive Oil** | 1-3 tbsp | Extra-virgin for best flavor |
| **Garlic** | 2-4 cloves | Adjust to preference; can use 1/4 tsp powder |
| **Dried Oregano** | 1-2 tsp | Classic pizza herb |
| **Fresh Basil** | 10-15 leaves | Add at end or as garnish |
| **Red Pepper Flakes** | 1/4 - 1/2 tsp | For heat |

### Fresh vs. Dried Herbs

| Type | When to Use | Ratio | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|-------|
| **Fresh** | Add at end or as garnish | 3:1 fresh to dried (1 tbsp fresh = 1 tsp dried) | Bright, delicate flavor |
| **Dried** | Add early for long cooking | Standard measurements | Concentrated, better for simmering |

**Dried oregano** is the classic pizza taste. **Fresh basil** should be added at the end or as garnish.

## Sauce Application

### Sauce Quantity by Pizza Size

| Pizza Size | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| 10-inch | ~1/4 cup (60g / 4 tbsp) |
| 12-inch | ~1/3 cup (80g / 5 tbsp) |
| 14-inch | ~1/2 cup (120g / 8 tbsp) |
| 16-inch | ~2/3 cup (160g / 10 tbsp) |
| 18-inch | ~3/4 cup (180g / 12 tbsp) |

**Note:** Less is more - you should see spots of dough through the sauce

### Spreading Technique (Spiral Method)

1. Pour desired sauce amount in center of stretched dough
2. Place flat-bottomed ladle (2 or 4-oz "spoodle") in center
3. Apply gentle pressure
4. Spread in spiral motion from center outward
5. Create even, consistent layer

### Edge Spacing by Style

- **Neapolitan & New York:** 1/2 to 1-inch border for crust to puff
- **Chicago Deep-Dish:** Sauce on top, typically to edge
- **Detroit:** Spread to very edge for caramelized crust
- **Sicilian:** 1/2 to 1-inch border

### Sauce Temperature

**Always use room temperature or cold sauce** - NEVER hot sauce on raw dough (causes premature cooking, gummy texture)

## Preventing Soggy Pizza

1. **Thicken sauce:** Simmer to reduce water content
2. **Use less sauce:** Thin, even layer
3. **Create barrier:** Brush dough lightly with olive oil before sauce
4. **High heat:** Cook at 500-550°F (260-290°C) on preheated stone/steel
5. **Pre-bake crust:** For thick crusts, par-bake 3-4 minutes first
6. **Cool on rack:** Let pizza rest 1-2 minutes on wire rack after baking

## Troubleshooting

### Sauce Too Acidic/Bitter
- Add pinch of sugar, honey, or grated carrots
- Small pinch baking soda neutralizes acidity (use sparingly)
- Don't use aluminum pan (reacts with tomatoes)

### Sauce Too Watery
- Simmer to reduce water content
- Add small amount tomato paste
- Drain canned tomatoes before use

### Sauce Too Bland
- Add salt, dried oregano, red pepper flakes, fresh basil
- Small amount tomato paste intensifies flavor
- Simmer longer to concentrate flavors

### Burnt Flavor
- Caused by overcooking garlic or ingredients
- Cook over low heat, stir occasionally
- If already burnt, start over (difficult to remove)

## Storage Guidelines

### Refrigerator
- **Homemade:** 4-7 days in airtight container
- **Store-bought (opened):** 7-10 days
- **Signs of spoilage:** Off odors, mold, discoloration, texture changes

### Freezer
- **Duration:** Up to 6 months
- **Best practices:**
  - Cool completely before freezing
  - Divide into usable portions
  - Use airtight freezer bags/containers, remove air
  - Label with date
- **Thawing:** Refrigerator overnight or microwave defrost

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using low-quality tomatoes:** Foundation of great sauce
2. **Not draining canned tomatoes:** Causes watery sauce
3. **Over-blending:** Ruins texture, releases bitterness from seeds
4. **Over-seasoning:** Tomatoes should be the star
5. **Adding unnecessary sugar:** Quality tomatoes are naturally sweet
6. **Using cold sauce:** Always room temperature
7. **Too much sauce:** Thin layer is ideal
8. **Not tasting as you go:** Season to taste at each step

## Matching Sauce to Pizza Style

- **Neapolitan:** Simple raw sauce (San Marzano, salt, basil, EVOO)
- **New York:** Cooked or raw, oregano-forward, hint of sweetness
- **Chicago Deep-Dish:** Thick, chunky, robust, on top of cheese
- **Detroit:** Sweet, thick, in stripes on top
- **Thin Crust:** Light, uncooked sauce keeps crust crispy
- **Thick Crust:** Thicker, more flavorful sauce
