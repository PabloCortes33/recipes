## Ingredients

*   1 medium sweet potato
*   1 tsp olive oil

2.  **Seasoning:** Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.
3.  **Air Frying:** Preheat the air fryer to 390°F (199°C).
4.  **Cooking:** Place the sweet potato in the air fryer basket and cook for about 30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until fork-tender. For larger sweet potatoes, the cooking time might need to be increased.
