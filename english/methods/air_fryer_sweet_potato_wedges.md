# Air Fryer Sweet Potato Wedges

Wedges offer a slightly different texture, often crispy on the outside and tender inside.

## Ingredients

*   1 lb sweet potatoes
*   1 tbsp olive oil
*   1 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)
*   1/2 tsp smoked paprika
*   Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1.  **Preparation:** Slice sweet potatoes lengthwise into wedges. The thickness will affect cooking time, with 1/4-inch thick wedges being a common recommendation. You can leave the skin on or peel them.
2.  **Seasoning:** Toss the wedges with oil and seasonings like nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.
3.  **Air Frying:** Preheat the air fryer to 375°F (190°C) for 5 minutes. Place the wedges in a single layer in the air fryer basket, ensuring they don't overlap too much.
4.  **Cooking:** Air fry for about 10 minutes, then check for doneness. If not fork-tender and crispy, continue cooking for another 2-5 minutes. For even browning, turn the wedges during cooking.
