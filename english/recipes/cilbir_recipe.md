# Çılbır (Turkish Eggs with Yogurt)

Çılbır is a traditional Turkish breakfast dish featuring perfectly poached eggs served over a bed of creamy, garlicky yogurt, finished with a vibrant, spiced butter or olive oil drizzle. It's surprisingly easy to make and offers a delightful contrast of warm, runny yolks, cool tangy yogurt, and spicy notes.

**Yields:** 2 servings
**Prep time:** 5 minutes
**Cook time:** 10 minutes

## Ingredients:

*   **For the Garlicky Yogurt:**
    *   1 cup plain Greek yogurt (whole milk preferred, at room temperature)
    *   1-2 cloves garlic, finely minced or grated
    *   ¼ teaspoon fine salt (or to taste)
    *   *Optional additions:* 1-2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or mint

*   **For the Poached Eggs:**
    *   2 large fresh eggs
    *   4 cups water
    *   1-2 tablespoons white vinegar (optional, but recommended for neat eggs)

*   **For the Spiced Butter/Oil Drizzle:**
    *   2-3 tablespoons unsalted butter or extra virgin olive oil (or a combination)
    *   1-2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes (or red pepper flakes)
    *   *Optional additions:* ½ teaspoon paprika, ¼ teaspoon ground cumin

*   **For Serving:**
    *   Crusty bread (such as sourdough, pita, or Turkish bread)
    *   Fresh herbs for garnish (e.g., dill, mint, parsley), optional
    *   Flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions:

1.  **Prepare the Garlicky Yogurt:** In a small bowl, combine the room-temperature Greek yogurt, minced garlic, and salt. Whisk until smooth. If using, stir in lemon juice, lemon zest, or fresh herbs. Divide the yogurt mixture between two shallow serving bowls and set aside. Allowing the yogurt to come to room temperature prevents it from being too cold when served with the warm eggs.

2.  **Poach the Eggs:**
    *   Fill a medium saucepan with about 3-4 inches of water and bring it to a gentle simmer over medium heat; avoid a rolling boil. Add the vinegar, if using, as it helps the egg whites coagulate.
    *   Crack each egg into a separate small bowl or ramekin. For neater poached eggs, you can gently swirl the egg in a fine-mesh sieve to drain off the very liquidy part of the whites.
    *   Using a wooden spoon, create a gentle whirlpool in the simmering water. Carefully slide one egg into the center of the whirlpool. Cook for 2-3 minutes for a firm white and a runny yolk.
    *   Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess water. Repeat with the second egg.

3.  **Make the Spiced Butter/Oil Drizzle:** While the second egg is poaching, melt the butter (or heat the olive oil) in a small pan over medium-low heat. Once melted and slightly foamy (if using butter), add the Aleppo pepper flakes (and optional paprika or cumin). Cook for about 30 seconds to 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant and the butter turns a light golden or hazelnut color. Be careful not to burn the spices.

4.  **Assemble and Serve:**
    *   Immediately transfer the poached eggs onto the prepared beds of garlicky yogurt in the serving bowls.
    *   Generously drizzle the warm spiced butter or oil over the eggs and yogurt.
    *   Garnish with fresh herbs, flaky sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper, if desired.
    *   Serve immediately with crusty bread for dipping and scooping up all the delicious flavors.
