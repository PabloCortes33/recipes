# Burrata with Roasted Cherry Tomatoes

## Overview

This stunning starter combines creamy burrata with sweet, caramelized roasted cherry tomatoes. The gentle roasting intensifies the tomatoes' natural sweetness and creates a warm, savory contrast to the cool, rich cheese. The combination of temperatures and textures makes this dish both comforting and elegant.

## Servings & Timing

- **Serves:** 4 as an appetizer
- **Prep Time:** 10 minutes
- **Cook Time:** 25-30 minutes
- **Total Time:** 35-40 minutes (plus time for burrata to reach room temperature)

## Ingredients

**For the Roasted Tomatoes:**
- 2 pints / 900g cherry tomatoes (about 4 cups)
- 3 tbsp / 45ml olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
- 3 cloves garlic, minced or thinly sliced
- 1 tsp / 5ml fresh thyme leaves (or 1/2 tsp dried)
- 1/2 tsp / 2.5g kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp / 1g freshly cracked black pepper
- Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)

**For Serving:**
- 2 balls fresh burrata cheese (8-8.8 oz / 225-250g total)
- Fresh basil leaves, torn
- Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling
- Flaky sea salt
- Crusty bread or crostini

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the oven:** Set oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Prepare the tomatoes:** Place cherry tomatoes in a large baking dish (9x13 inch or similar). They should fit in a single layer with a little room between them.

3. **Season the tomatoes:** Drizzle with 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add the minced garlic, thyme, kosher salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Toss everything together until tomatoes are well coated.

4. **Roast:** Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and roast for 25-30 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft, blistered, and starting to burst. Some should be slightly caramelized. The juices will create a delicious sauce at the bottom of the pan.

5. **Cool slightly:** Remove from oven and let cool for 5-10 minutes. The tomatoes should be warm but not piping hot when served with the burrata.

6. **Bring burrata to room temperature:** While tomatoes are roasting (or earlier), remove burrata from refrigerator and let sit for 30-60 minutes.

7. **Plate the dish:** Arrange the roasted tomatoes on a serving platter, including all the flavorful juices and garlic from the pan. Place the burrata balls in the center, either whole or gently torn into pieces.

8. **Garnish:** Scatter fresh torn basil leaves over the dish. Drizzle with additional extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.

9. **Serve immediately:** Present with crusty bread or crostini for scooping up the creamy cheese and sweet tomatoes.

## Why This Works

- **Temperature contrast:** Warm tomatoes against cool/room temperature burrata creates an exciting sensory experience
- **Roasting intensifies sweetness:** Heat caramelizes the tomatoes' natural sugars, reducing acidity
- **Garlic infusion:** Roasting garlic with the tomatoes creates a mellow, sweet flavor throughout
- **Texture variation:** Burst tomatoes provide a soft, jammy texture that complements the creamy cheese

## Tips for Success

- **Choose ripe tomatoes:** Use ripe, sweet cherry or grape tomatoes for the best flavor
- **Don't overcrowd:** Give tomatoes space in the pan so they roast rather than steam
- **Watch for bursting:** You want most tomatoes to burst and release their juices, creating a natural sauce
- **Adjust roasting time:** Oven temperatures vary; check at 20 minutes and continue if needed
- **Serve warm, not hot:** Let tomatoes cool slightly so they don't melt the burrata too quickly
- **Save the pan juices:** The flavorful oil and tomato juice at the bottom of the pan is liquid gold - use it all

## Make-Ahead Tips

- Roasted tomatoes can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and stored in the refrigerator
- Reheat gently in a low oven (300°F/150°C) for 10 minutes before serving
- Bring burrata to room temperature 30-60 minutes before serving
- Assemble the dish just before serving for best presentation

## Storage

- Leftover roasted tomatoes can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days
- Use the tomatoes on pasta, pizza, sandwiches, or bruschetta
- The infused oil is delicious for dipping bread or drizzling on salads

## Wine Pairing

- **Italian whites:** Vermentino, Pinot Grigio, or Gavi
- **Sparkling:** Prosecco or Franciacorta
- **Light reds:** Pinot Noir or Valpolicella (slightly chilled)

## Variations

- **Add balsamic:** Drizzle with aged balsamic vinegar or balsamic glaze before serving
- **Include prosciutto:** Add torn prosciutto for a salty contrast
- **Herb variation:** Try fresh oregano or rosemary instead of thyme
- **Spicy version:** Increase red pepper flakes or add sliced fresh chili
- **With arugula:** Serve on a bed of peppery arugula for added freshness
