# Best Homemade Tzatziki Sauce Recipe

This recipe emphasizes fresh ingredients and a crucial step to prevent a watery sauce, ensuring a creamy and flavorful tzatziki.

**Yields:** Approximately 1.5 cups
**Prep time:** 15-20 minutes (plus chilling time)

**Ingredients:**

*   1/2 to 1 English cucumber (about 1 cup grated)
*   1 cup plain, full-fat Greek yogurt (strained for best results)
*   2-3 cloves garlic, minced or finely grated
*   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or white/red wine vinegar
*   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
*   1-2 tablespoons fresh dill, finely chopped (optional, but commonly used)
*   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
*   1/4 teaspoon black pepper, or to taste

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the Cucumber:** Peel the cucumber. For a less watery sauce, you can deseed it by scooping out the seedy center with a spoon. Grate the cucumber using the large holes of a box grater.
2.  **Drain the Cucumber (Crucial Step):** Place the grated cucumber in a clean kitchen towel, cheesecloth, or several layers of paper towels. Squeeze out as much excess liquid as possible over a sink. This step is vital to prevent your tzatziki from becoming watery.
3.  **Prepare the Yogurt (Optional, for extra thickness):** If your Greek yogurt isn't very thick, you can strain it further. Line a fine-mesh sieve with a coffee filter or cheesecloth and place it over a bowl. Add the yogurt and let it drain in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.
4.  **Combine Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, combine the drained grated cucumber, strained Greek yogurt, minced garlic, lemon juice (or vinegar), olive oil, chopped fresh dill (if using), salt, and black pepper.
5.  **Mix and Chill:** Stir all ingredients together until well combined. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour to allow the flavors to meld.
6.  **Serve:** Serve chilled with pita bread, vegetables, grilled meats, or as a dip.

**Tips for Success:**

*   **Full-Fat Greek Yogurt:** Using full-fat Greek yogurt provides the best texture and flavor.
*   **Drain Cucumber Thoroughly:** This is the most important step to avoid a watery tzatziki.
*   **Fresh Garlic:** Use fresh garlic and mince or grate it finely to avoid large, unpleasant pieces.
*   **Chilling Time:** Allowing the tzatziki to chill helps the flavors deepen and meld together.
*   **Dill vs. Mint:** While dill is common, some authentic Greek recipes might use fresh mint instead, or omit herbs entirely.
