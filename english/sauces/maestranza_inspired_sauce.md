# Maestranza-Inspired Savory Orange Sauce

This recipe aims to recreate the savory, slightly spicy, light orange sauce you described. It uses a mayonnaise base and gets its characteristic flavor and color from *merkén*, a traditional Chilean smoked chili spice. If you cannot find merkén, a combination of smoked paprika and a pinch of cayenne pepper is a good substitute.

This type of sauce is a classic accompaniment for french fries (*papas fritas*) and fried fish sandwiches in Chile.

## Ingredients

*   **1 cup** (240g) high-quality mayonnaise
*   **1-2 cloves** garlic, minced or pressed (or 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder for a less "fresh" taste)
*   **1 teaspoon** merkén (adjust to taste)
*   **1/2 teaspoon** onion powder
*   **1 teaspoon** white vinegar or fresh lemon juice
*   **Salt** to taste (start with a small pinch, as the mayonnaise is already salted)

## Instructions

1.  **Combine Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, add the mayonnaise, minced garlic (or garlic powder), merkén, onion powder, and white vinegar or lemon juice.

2.  **Whisk Thoroughly**: Whisk all the ingredients together until the sauce is smooth and has a uniform, light orange color.

3.  **Taste and Adjust**: Taste the sauce. Add a pinch of salt if needed, or more merkén if you desire a smokier, spicier flavor.

4.  **Rest for Flavor**: For the best results, cover the bowl and let the sauce rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This allows the flavors of the spices to fully meld into the mayonnaise.

5.  **Serve**: Serve chilled alongside hot french fries, as a spread for a fried fish sandwich, or with other savory fried foods.
