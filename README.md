# 🍳 Recipes Collection

A dynamic recipe browser that displays your markdown recipes in an organized, easy-to-navigate web interface. Works as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on mobile devices!

## Features

- 📱 **Mobile-First Design** - Fully responsive, optimized for iPhone and all devices
- 📁 **Collapsible Folders** - Organized by language (English/Spanish) and category
- 📖 **Markdown Viewer** - Read recipes directly in the browser with beautiful formatting
- 🔄 **Easy Updates** - Just run one script to regenerate everything
- ⚡ **Progressive Web App** - Install on your home screen like a native app
- 🚀 **Offline Support** - Access your recipes even without internet (after first visit)

## How to Use

### Adding New Recipes

1. Add your markdown files to the appropriate folder:
   - `english/recipes/` or `spanish/recipes/`
   - `english/methods/` or `spanish/methods/`
   - etc.

2. Regenerate the index:
   ```bash
   node generate_manifest.js
   ```

3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add new recipes"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Viewing Locally

To test your recipes locally, you need a web server (due to browser security restrictions):

```bash
./start_server.sh
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to your repository Settings → Pages
3. Under "Source", select your `main` branch
4. Click Save
5. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/recipes`

**On iPhone:** Visit the site in Safari, tap the Share button, then "Add to Home Screen". Your recipe app will work like a native app with offline support!
